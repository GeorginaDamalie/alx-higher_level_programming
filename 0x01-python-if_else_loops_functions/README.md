# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project covers various concepts in Python programming, including conditionals (`if`, `if...else`), loops (`for` and `while`), and functions. The tasks involve writing Python scripts and functions to perform specific operations, such as checking if a character is lowercase, printing patterns, arithmetic operations, and more.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Positive or Negative
The program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

### Task 1: Last Digit
The program assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints its last digit along with additional information.

### Task 2: Print Alphabet
Prints the lowercase alphabet using a single `print` statement and a loop.

### Task 3: Print Alphabet Except q and e
Prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters 'q' and 'e' using a single `print` statement and a loop.

### Task 4: Hexadecimal Printing
Prints decimal and hexadecimal representations of numbers from 0 to 98.

### Task 5: 00...99
Prints numbers from 0 to 99 in two-digit format, separated by commas.

### Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials
Prints all possible combinations of two digits in ascending order, separated by commas.

### Task 7: islower
Defines a function `islower(c)` that checks if a character is lowercase without using `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`.

### Task 8: To uppercase
Defines a function `uppercase(str)` that prints a string in uppercase, avoiding `str.upper()`.

### Task 9: Last Digit - Mandatory
Defines a function `print_last_digit(number)` that prints the last digit of a number.

### Task 10: a + b
Defines a function `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of two integers.

### Task 11: a ^ b
Defines a function `pow(a, b)` that calculates `a` raised to the power of `b`.

### Task 12: Fizz Buzz
Defines a function `fizzbuzz()` that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

### Task 13: Insert in sorted linked list
Defines a function `insert_node(head, number)` in C that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.

### Task 14: Smile in the mirror - Advanced
Prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase.

### Task 15: Remove at position - Advanced
Defines a function `remove_char_at(str, n)` that creates a copy of a string with the character at position `n` removed.

### Task 16: ByteCode -> Python #2 - Advanced
Matches a given Python bytecode using a Python function.
