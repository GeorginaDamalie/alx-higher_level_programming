this repository contains Python programs for various tasks. Each task focuses on different aspects of programming, such as importing functions, handling command-line arguments, performing mathematical operations, and adhering to specific constraints.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Import and Print Addition
The program imports the function `add(a, b)` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition of 1 + 2 = 3.

### Task 1: Import and Perform Math
The program imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, performs mathematical operations on variables, and prints the results.

### Task 2: Print Number of Arguments
The program prints the number of and the list of its arguments passed through the command line.

### Task 3: Sum of Command-Line Arguments
The program prints the result of adding all the integer arguments passed through the command line.

### Task 4: Print Names from Compiled Module
The program prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### Task 5: Import Variable and Print Value
The program imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

### Task 6: Calculator with Custom Operators
The program imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and performs basic operations based on command-line input.

### Task 7: Print Without Print Function
The program prints `#pythoniscool` without using the `print` function.

### Task 8: Reverse Engineering
Defines a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that matches a specific Python bytecode.

### Task 9: Uppercase Alphabet without Loops
Prints the uppercase alphabet without using any loops or conditional statements.

## How to Run

To execute each program, navigate to the respective task's directory and run the corresponding Python script. Follow the instructions provided in each task description to understand the required inputs and expected outputs. The repository structure ensures that each program is contained within its own directory for easy access and testing.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to gain a deeper understanding of Python programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
